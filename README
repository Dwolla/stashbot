Stashbot Helper is a plugin designed to enable a continuous integration
workflow within stash (similar to gerrit + jenkins).

==== INSTALL GUIDE ====

To work with Jenkins, you MUST install the following jenkins plugins first.

1. Jenkins GIT plugin
2. Post build task

If either of these are missing, shit won't work.

==== DEV GUIDE ====

Eclipse config:

1. Generate project files by running `atlas-mvn eclipse:eclipse`
2. Load the code formatter settings by going to preferences, filtering on
"formatter", selecting Java -> Code Style -> Formatter, and importing the xml
file in code-style directory.
3. Load the cleanup settings by going to preferences, filtering on "cleanup" (also under code style) and import the cleanup xml file from the code-style directory.
4. Finally, again under preferences, filter on "save actions" for the java editor and check the options for "format source code", "format all lines", and "organize imports".

Doing these 4 things will ensure you do not introduce unneccessary whitespace changes.

Jenkins:

To run jenkins for testing, simply obtain a suitable jenkins.war and run the
scripts in bin/ and follow the above steps for setting up Jenkins

To install a custom version of the jenkins-client library, do something like this:

atlas-mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/home/cmyers/gitrepos/jenkins-client/target/jenkins-client-0.1.5-SNAPSHOT.jar -DgroupId=com.offbytwo.jenkins -DartifactId=jenkins-client -Dversion=0.1.5-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -DpomFile=/home/cmyers/gitrepos/jenkins-client/pom.xml

==== TODO ====

Currently planned features:

* Test coverage
* Error checking - validate hashes sent to build status, etc.
* Any project can enable verification builds in a jenkins instance with a single click
* Any commit can be built automatically with a single click
* New pushes or pull requests are automatically verified

Future features:

* Change PullRequestBuildSuccessMergeCheck to only listen to comments made by the appropriate user? (not really necessary since we allow any user to ==override==).
* Separate publish build versus verification build (depending on branch name)
* Allow multiple jenkins instances
