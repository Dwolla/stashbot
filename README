Stashbot Helper is a plugin designed to enable a continuous integration
workflow within stash (similar to gerrit + jenkins).

The first major release of stashbot should have the following features:

* Any project can enable verification builds in a jenkins instance with a single click
* Any commit can be built automatically with a single click
* New pushes or pull requests are automatically verified


Future features:

* Separate publish build versus verification build (depending on branch name)
* Allow multiple jenkins instances
