Stashbot Helper is a plugin designed to enable a continuous integration
workflow within stash (similar to gerrit + jenkins).

==== DEV GUIDE

Eclipse config:

1. Generate project files by running `atlas-mvn eclipse:eclipse`
2. Load the code formatter settings by going to preferences, filtering on
"formatter", selecting Java -> Code Style -> Formatter, and importing the xml
file in code-style directory.
3. Load the cleanup settings by going to preferences, filtering on "cleanup" (also under code style) and import the cleanup xml file from the code-style directory.
4. Finally, again under preferences, filter on "save actions" for the java editor and check the options for "format source code", "format all lines", and "organize imports".

Doing these 4 things will ensure you do not introduce unneccessary whitespace changes.
